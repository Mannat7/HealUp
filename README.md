# HealUp
HealUp is a web-application aimed at making our heathcare system more efficient and comfortable for all. 
It is a platform able to recognize faces and provide the details about the patient's last visit to the hospital. It currently provides the visit details of the patient, equipped with face recognition. It will be expanded to be able to consolidate and maintain the medical records of a patient.
It can be used for a hostpital's website, so whenever a patient visits any branch of the hospital anywhere, his face will be recognised by the face recognition system and his details will easily be accessible to the hospital staff and they'll be able to start the treatment accordingly. 
The medical history of the patients plays a vital role in the further treatment and hence, transparency is important here. 
So, HealUp is here to provide just that!
